# HSP - Helping Sinle Parents
A 24-hour group project developed in the context of the &lt;A/C_>'s Hackathon.

The idea of the project was to design in a time frame of 24 hours a web app which could be related to the theme found in the music "Keep ya Head Up" from 2pac. The group interpreted the song as targeting situations where a parent is abandoned to raise a child alone.
After consideration, the group decided to create a online community in which such parents could ask for non-financial help, such as searching for babysitter volunteers, private teachers and more.

## Deployment

The goal was to present a webapp where the users could register and follow up with requests for non-financial help.
